      <h1>Loan Amortization Calculator - User Guide</h1>
      <p>
        The Loan Amortization Calculator helps users understand loan repayment
        structures, interest calculations, and financial implications. By
        entering loan details, users can analyze different repayment scenarios
        and their impact on total interest.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Loan Type</h2>
      <p>The calculator supports four types of loans:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Amortized Loan (Reducing Balance)</strong>: Regular payments
          consisting of principal and interest. The principal portion increases
          over time while interest decreases, ensuring full repayment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interest-Only Loan</strong>: Only interest payments are made
          during a specified period. The full principal is due at the end of the
          term.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Partially Amortized Loan</strong>: Regular payments reduce the
          principal, but a portion remains unpaid. This remaining balance
          (balloon payment) is due at the end of the loan.
        </li>
        <div class="note">
          Note: For partially amortized loans, if the loan is partially
          amortized, the balloon payment must be specified; otherwise, it is
          defaulted to zero.
        </div>
        <li>
          <strong>Flat Interest Rate Loan</strong>: This loan type has constant
          interest and principal repayments. The interest is calculated as a
          percentage of the amount borrowed, divided by the loan duration, while
          the capital repayment is the amount borrowed divided by the loan
          duration.
        </li>
        <div class="note">
          Note: For flat interest rate loans, the repayment description is set
          to "Level" by default, and the interest type is set to "Nominal" by
          default. These default values are not influenced by their
          corresponding input cells.
        </div>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Repayment Timeframe</h2>
      <p>Determines how often loan payments are made per year:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Annually (once per year)</li>
        <li>Semi-Annually (twice per year)</li>
        <li>Quarterly (four times per year)</li>
        <li>Bimonthly (six times per year)</li>
        <li>Monthly (twelve times per year - default)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Interest Rate</h2>
      <p>The cost of borrowing, expressed as a percentage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Effective Interest Rate (default)</strong>: Adjusted for
          compounding periods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nominal Interest Rate</strong>: The stated rate, not adjusted
          for compounding.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Repayment Description</h2>
      <p>Determines how the loan principal is repaid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Level (Default)</strong>: Fixed payments throughout the loan
          term.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increasing</strong>: Starts with a lower payment that
          gradually increases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decreasing</strong>: Starts with a higher payment that
          gradually decreases.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note">
        Note: For increasing or decreasing repayments, specify the adjustment
        amount using the "By" input field; otherwise, it defaults to zero. Flat
        interest rate loans do not require this field.
      </div>

      <h2>5. Amount Borrowed</h2>
      <p>
        The total loan amount requested, which serves as the principal for
        interest calculations.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Loan Term</h2>
      <p>
        The duration of the loan, which represents how long it will last. It is
        measured in months.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Start Date</h2>
      <p>
        The date the loan is initiated, used to schedule repayments and
        calculate interest accrual.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Client Name</h2>
      <p>
        A field for businesses or individuals to personalize their loan schedule
        report. The entered name appears on the printed report.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding loan inputs is crucial for financial planning. This
        calculator helps borrowers and lenders compare different loan structures
        and repayment plans to make informed financial decisions.
